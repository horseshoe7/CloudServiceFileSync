To do
======


- Investigate why Settings > iCloud > Manage Storage might not display the app name, but takes its value from the iCloud container name, even though the NSUbiquitousContainers part of Info.plist specifies the folder name...

- Make sure your list function on iCloud is only listing non-hidden files, or you can specify what should be in the list.
    - I had a temp file that I didn't create called ".TestFile.txt.iCloud"
    
- Things you need to consider:
    - a CloudStorageController doesn't do everything on its own.  It's dumb and should do what a CloudServiceController tells it to
    - Thus, you have to consider if a Syncable changes its infos (especially the count!), the CloudServiceController will know how to do housekeeping.
        - Write a test first


# You have to think about fileURLs and maybe make them more explicit on a SyncableFileInfo

for example, you'll have filename

but then maybe remoteFileURL and localFileURL and they both be optional but at least one will always be defined.

WHY?  When you list the application folder, if they only have remoteURL then it's clear that you still need to match it up on the local side.

# SyncableFileInfo might have to be a class type.  I'm passing them around in arrays a lot
# Add Progress Block update callbacks

- Not sure threading is safe.  Running testSimpleSync will show some funky Sync numbers:

4/8: Syncing... - C.txt - UPLOAD - succeeded
5/8: Syncing... - E.txt - DELETE - succeeded
8/8: Syncing... - D.txt - DOWNLOAD - succeeded
8/8: Syncing... - A.txt - DOWNLOAD - succeeded
8/8: Syncing... - I.txt - DOWNLOAD - succeeded

But then sometimes it's correct.  So there's some sort of non thread safe activity going on...
- or it's just with respect to the variable getting written to and read from.  Still.  Why? I'm adding work items to queues.


Make sure updatedAt fields are getting updated appropriately.

Also really be clear on where the SyncableFileInfos originated (local or remote)  (consider a property or a subclass)
